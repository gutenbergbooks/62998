</div>


<h3><a id="UNSATISFACTORY_YIELDS"></a>UNSATISFACTORY YIELDS OF SWEET-CLOVER SEED.</h3>

<p>In some sections of the country much trouble has been experienced
for a few years past in obtaining satisfactory yields of sweet-clover
seed. This difficulty has been due for the most part to the following
causes: (1) To cutting the plants at an improper stage of development,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
(2) to the use of machinery not adapted to the handling of the
crop, (3) to the shedding of immature pods, and (4) possibly to the
lack of pollination. As the first two have been overcome, mainly
because of a better understanding of the requirements for handling
this crop, the subject matter of this bulletin is concerned primarily
with the factors which produce the third and fourth causes.</p>

<p>Where the production of seed was disappointing although the
plants produced an abundance of flowers, it has been observed
that many apparently were not fertilized, or if fertilized the pods
aborted. In order to obtain data in regard to the causes of the
failure of sweet clover to produce a normal seed yield, a study was
made of the insects which were most active in pollinating the flowers,
the source of the pollen necessary to effect fertilization, and the
conditions under which the flowers must be pollinated in order to
become fertilized. The relation of environmental conditions to the
shedding of immature pods was also investigated. In order to
overcome local environmental factors as much as possible, the
experiments were conducted on the Government Experiment Farm
at Arlington, Va., and in cooperation with the botanical department
of the Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa.</p>


<h3><a id="PREVIOUS_INVESTIGATIONS"></a>PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE POLLINATION OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Since Darwin (<a href="#lit_4">4</a>, p. 360)<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> published the statement that a plant of
<i>Melilotus officinalis</i> protected from insect visitation produced but a
very few seeds, while an unprotected plant produced many, other
scientists have investigated this subject. Knuth (<a href="#lit_19">19</a>, v. 1, p. 37), in
giving a list of the best known cases of self-sterility in plants, mentions
<i>Melilotus officinalis</i>. The same author (<a href="#lit_19">19</a>, v. 2, p. 282) states
that since the stigma projects beyond the anthers, automatic self-pollination
is difficult, and for the same reasons Müller (<a href="#lit_29">29</a>, p. 180)
believes that self-fertilization is not apt to occur.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The serial numbers in parentheses refer to "Literature cited," pages 36-38.</p></div>

<p>In 1901 Kirchner (<a href="#lit_18">18</a>, p. 7) covered a number of <i>Melilotus alba</i>
racemes with nets. On one of the plants 12 protected racemes
produced 187 seeds and on another plant only one seed was obtained
from 10 covered racemes. This experiment was duplicated in 1904,
with the result that 40 netted racemes produced an average of 38 seeds
each. Kirchner concluded from this experiment that spontaneous
self-pollination occurs regularly even though the stigma projects
above the anthers. He (<a href="#lit_18">18</a>, p. 8) also performed an experiment with
<i>Melilotus officinalis</i> in 1901. At this time 16 isolated racemes produced
a total of 11 seeds. This experiment was repeated in 1904,
with the result that 16 protected racemes produced an average of 14
seeds each. As the racemes on one of the plants that was protected
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
in 1904 died, Kirchner concluded that the flowers of <i>M. officinalis</i>
were especially sensitive to inclosure in nets and that the failures to
obtain more than a very few seeds on protected racemes in Darwin's
experiment and in his first experiment were due to this cause.</p>

<p>According to Kerner (<a href="#lit_17">17</a>, v. 2, p. 399) the peas and lentils (Pisum
and Ervum) and the different species of horned clover and stone
clover (Lotus and Melilotus) as well as the numerous species of the
genus Trifolium and also many others produce seeds when insects
are excluded from the plants, and only isolated species of these
genera gave poor yields without insect visitation.</p>


<h3><a id="OUTLINE_OF_POLLINATING"></a>OUTLINE OF POLLINATING EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>The yield of sweet-clover seed varies greatly from year to year in
many parts of the United States. It has been assumed that this
variation was due to climatic conditions, as excellent seed crops were
seldom harvested in seasons of excessive rainfall or of prolonged
drought just preceding or during the flowering period. The lack of
a sufficient number of suitable pollinating insects also was thought
to be an important factor in reducing seed production. This was
especially true where the acreage of sweet clover was large and where
few, if any, honeybees were kept.</p>

<p>In order to obtain data upon the factors influencing the yield of
seed, a series of experiments was outlined to determine (1) whether
the flowers are able to set seed without the assistance of outside agencies,
(2) whether cross-pollination is necessary, (3) the different kinds
of insects which are active agents in pollinating sweet clover, and (4)
whether a relation exists between the quantity of moisture in the soil
and the production of seed.</p>

<p>The racemes containing the flowers which were to be pollinated by
hand were covered with tarlatan before any of the flowers opened and
were kept covered except while being pollinated until the seeds were
nearly mature. This cloth has about twice as many meshes to the
linear inch as ordinary mosquito netting and served to exclude all
insects that are able to pollinate the flowers. When entire plants
were to be protected from all outside agencies, cages covered with
cheesecloth, glass frames, or wire netting were used.</p>

<p>A preliminary study of the pollination of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i>
showed that both were visited by the same kinds of insects
and that both required the same methods of pollination in order to
set seed. On this account <i>M. alba</i> was used in most of the experiments
reported in this bulletin. Where <i>M. officinalis</i> was employed
it is so stated.</p>

<h3><a id="STRUCTURE"></a>STRUCTURE OF THE FLOWERS OF MELILOTUS ALBA.</h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp69" id="fig1" style="max-width: 26.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig1.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="fig_caption2"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Different parts of the flower of <i>Melilotus alba</i>: 1, Side view of the flower; 2, side view of the flower
    with the carina and alæ slightly depressed; 3, side view of the flower, showing the carina and alæ depressed
    sufficiently to expose the staminal tube and the tenth free stamen; 4, ala; 5, ate and carina

    stamen; <i>h</i>, digitate process of the superior basal angle of an ala; <i>i</i>, depressions in the ala; <i>j</i>, staminal
    tube; <i>k</i>, pistil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The racemes of <i>Melilotus alba</i> contain from 10 to 120 flowers with
an average of approximately 50 per raceme for all of the racemes of
a plant growing under cultivation in a field containing a good stand.</p>

<p>The flower consists of a green, smooth, or slightly pubescent calyx
with 5-pointed lobes and with an irregular white corolla of five petals.
(<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1.</a>) The claws of the petals are not united nor are they attached
to the staminal tube which is formed by the union of the filaments of
the nine inferior stamens. As the claws of the alæ and carina are not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
attacked to the staminal tube; the petals may be bent downward
sufficiently far so that many different kinds of insects may secure
without difficulty the nectar secreted around the base of the ovary.</p>

<p>The fingerlike processes of the alæ are appressed closely to the
carina, therefore the alæ are bent downward with the carina by
insects. These processes grasp the staminal tube superiorly and
tightly when the carina and alæ are in their natural positions, but
when the carina is pressed downward by insects the fingerlike processes
open slightly but not so far that they do not spring back to their
original position when the pressure is
removed. The staminal tube splits
superiorly to admit the tenth free
stamen. The filament of this superior
stamen lies along the side of this
staminal tube. The filaments of the
nine stamens which compose the staminal tube separate in the hollow of the
carina. All stamens bear fertile anthers. The pistil is in the staminal
tube, the upper part of the style and
stigma of which is inclosed with the
anthers in the carina. The stigma
is slightly above the stamens.</p>

<p>An insect inserts its head into a
sweet-clover flower between the vexillum and carina, the stigma, therefore,
comes into direct contact with the
head of the insect and cross-pollination
is effected. At the same time the anthers brush against the insect, so that
its head is dusted with pollen, to be
carried to other flowers.</p>


<h3><a id="DEVELOPMENT_ORGANS"></a>DEVELOPMENT OF THE FLORAL ORGANS OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<div class="figright illowp53" id="fig2" style="max-width: 10.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig2.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="fig_caption2"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Lengthwise sectional view of a very
    young flower of <i>Melilotus alba</i>, showing the
    relative development of the stamens and

    while division is just beginning in the
    lower set of stamens. In the ovules the
    outer integuments are well started on their

</div>

<p>The stamens of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i> may be divided
into two sets, according to their length and time of development.
(<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2.</a>) The longer set extends about the length of the anthers
above the shorter set, and the pollen mother cells in the longer set
divide to form pollen grains at least two days earlier than those in
the shorter set. At the time the pollen mother cells divide, the
longer set of stamens is approximately three-eighths of a millimeter
in length and the pistil about half a millimeter long. The stigma
and a portion of the style project beyond the stamens, and this relative
position is maintained to maturity. The pollen mother cells
undergo the reduction division while the megaspore mother cells are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
just being differentiated and while the outer integuments are barely
prominent at the base of the nucellus. The pollen grains are formed
while the embryo sac is beginning to develop. The division of the
megaspore mother cell does not occur until a number of days later,
and the embryo sac is not mature until the flower is nearly ready to
open. Thus, the pollen grains are formed a week to 10 days before
the embryo sac is ready for fertilization. The pollen grains increase
in size and undergo internal changes after their formation. These
changes, which are not completed until the flower is one-half or more
of its mature length, may be regarded as the ripening processes, and
they are undoubtedly necessary before the pollen is capable of functioning.
For this reason it is probable that the pollen grains are not
able to function much before the embryo sac is mature.</p>

    character and the position of the pollen in reference to the papillæ

</div>

<p>The pistils of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i> are straight for
the greater part of
their length, but curve
rather abruptly toward
the keel just below the
capitate stigma. The
surface of the stigma
is papillate. (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3.</a>)
In their reaction with
Sudan III, alkanin, and
safranin the Walls of
the papillæ of the stigma
show that some fatlike substances are present. Aside from water,
the contents of the papillæ consist chiefly of a fine emulsion of oil.</p>


<h4>DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVULES.</h4>

<p>The number of ovules in the ovary of <i>Melilotus alba</i> varies from
two to five; however, most commonly, three or four ovules occur.
In <i>Melilotus officinalis</i> the number in each ovary ranges from three
to six. In both species the ovules are campylotropous at maturity
with the micropylar end turned toward the base of the ovary.</p>

<p>Mature ovules contain two integuments, but the inner one does
not close entirely around the end of the nucellus. The outer integument
develops considerably ahead of the inner one. The outer
integument is much thickened at the micropylar end, the seed coat
is formed from it, and the inner integument is used as nourishment
by the endosperm and embryo.</p>

<p>The number of megaspore mother cells in an ovule varies from
one to many. Two or more embryo sacs often start to develop in
the same ovule, but seldom more than one matures. (<a href="#plate1">Pl. I, figs. 1, 2, and 3.</a>)
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
In general, the development of the embryo sac proceeds
in the ordinary way, as described by Young (<a href="#lit_44">44</a>, p. 133), with the
inner megaspore functioning. (Text <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a> and <a href="#plate2f1">Pl. II, fig. 1</a>.) In its
development the nucellus is destroyed rapidly, the destruction being
most rapid first at the micropylar end proceeding backward. The
nucellus is completely destroyed at the micropylar end by the time
the embryo sac is mature, and consequently the embryo sac comes in
contact with the outer integument in this region. (<a href="#plate2f1">Pl. II, fig. 1.</a>)
As the destruction of the nucellus extends toward the chalazal end
the embryo sac becomes much elongated and tubelike. The antipodals
disappear early, so that a mature embryo sac consists of the
egg, the synergids, and the two polars. The two polars lie in contact
in the micropylar end of
the sac near the egg until
fertilization.</p>

<h4>STERILITY OF THE OVULES.</h4>

<div class="figright illowp77" id="fig4" style="max-width: 16.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig4.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="fig_caption2"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Median section through an ovule, showing the embryo
    sac with four nuclei and the position of the integuments.
    × 150.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i> there is very
little tendency toward
sterility of ovules. In an
extended study of ovules
developing under normal
and under excessive moisture conditions only an
occasional one was found
in which no reproductive
cells were differentiated,
and no ovaries were found
in which all of the ovules
were sterile.</p>


<h4>DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLLEN.</h4>

<p>The pollen mother cells do not separate, but previous to the reduction
division the protoplasm shrinks from the walls, thus forming a
dense globular mass which often occupies less than half the lumen of
the mother cell. (<a href="#plate1">Pl. I, fig. 4.</a>) Nuclear division occurs while they
are in this contracted condition, and four nuclei are formed from two
successive divisions. The cytoplasm is equally distributed around
each nucleus. The four masses of protoplasm separate, and as they
enlarge a number of times and develop into mature pollen grains they
become binucleate, and a wall is gradually formed around each.
(<a href="#plate1">Pl. I, figs. 5 and 6.</a>) At first the cytoplasm is quite dense and contains
some starch but no fatty oils. However, the cytoplasm of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
mature pollen grains is vacuolate, and it contains a fatty oil in the
form of an emulsion. Soon after the pollen grains are formed, the
walls of the mother cells disappear, thus permitting the pollen grains
to lie loose in the anther.</p>


<h3><a id="FERTILIZATION"></a>FERTILIZATION IN MELILOTUS ALBA.</h3>

<p>The time intervening between pollination and fertilization was
investigated with both self-pollinated and cross-pollinated flowers.
In cross-pollination the parents were separate plants. This point
was investigated with plants out of doors during the summer of 1916
and with plants in the greenhouse during the following winter. The
time elapsing between pollination and fertilization ranged from 50 to
55 hours and was not longer in the case of self-pollinated than with
cross-pollinated flowers. Furthermore, the rate of the development
of the embryo in each kind of pollination was studied and was found
to be as rapid in self-pollination as in cross-pollination. Therefore,
self-pollination is apparently as effective as cross-pollination in
<i>Melilotus alba</i> so far as the vigor of pollen tubes and the rate at which
embryos develop are concerned. <i>Melilotus officinalis</i> was not studied
in reference to this point.</p>

<p>Considerable difference often exists in the size of the young embryos
in the ovules of the same pod. This is due in part to a difference
in the time of fertilization, although some of it is due to a difference
in nourishment. It was observed that the ovule first fertilized
might be an upper one, lower one, or any one between these. Occasionally
one or more ovules are not fertilized.</p>


<h3><a id="DEVELOPMENT_SEED"></a>DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEED.</h3>

<p>A proembryo with a rather long suspensor is developed from the
fertilized egg. (<a href="#plate2f2">Pl. II, fig. 2</a>). The endosperm, which quite early
forms a peripheral layer around the entire embryo sac, develops most
rapidly about the embryo, which soon becomes thoroughly embedded
in it. (<a href="#plate3">Pl. III, figs. 1 and 2.</a>) After the embryo has used up the
endosperm in the micropylar end and has enlarged so much as to
occupy nearly all of the space in this region, the development of the
endosperm becomes more active in the chalazal end, and when the
embryo is mature there is very little endosperm left.</p>

<p>The seed coat begins to form about the time of fertilization,
although it apparently does not depend upon it, for in ovules where
fertilization is prevented the outer integument undergoes the early
modifications in the development of the seed coat before the ovule
breaks down. The development of the seed coat is apparent first at
the micropylar and chalazal ends, where the outer cells of the outer
integument become much elongated and their outer walls thicken
very soon after fertilization. The modifications in the development
of the seed coat extend around the ovule from these points, involving
at first only the outer or epidermal layer of cells which form the
malpighian layer. Later, the cells just beneath the malpighian layer
form the osteosclerid layer. Accompanying or closely following the
formation of the osteosclerid cells, the remaining cell layers of the
outer integument become modified into the nutritive and aleurone
layer, and the seed coat is fully formed. Meantime the inner integument
is practically all used as food.</p>

<h3><a id="MATURE_POLLEN"></a>MATURE POLLEN OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>The pollen grains of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and of <i>M. officinalis</i> are quite
similar. Each grain contains three germ pores, and when viewed
so that the pores are visible they present a slightly angled appearance.
The average dimensions of the pollen of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and of <i>M. officinalis</i>
are 26 by 32 microns and 24 by 30 microns, respectively, when
measured in the positions shown in <i>b</i> in <a href="#plate1">Plate I, figure 6</a>.</p>

<p>The walls of the pollen grains have cutin deposited in them, as
shown by their reactions with Sudan III, alkanin, safranin, and
chloriodid of zinc. The contents of the pollen grains give a distinct
reaction when tested for fat, and Millon's reagent shows that also
some protein is present. Tests for sugars and starch showed that
these substances are not present in perceptible quantities in mature
pollen grains, although some starch is present in immature pollen.</p>


<h3><a id="GERMINATION"></a>GERMINATION OF THE POLLEN.</h3>

<p>The germination of the pollen of <i>Melilotus alba</i> permits considerable
variation in moisture, as is illustrated in <a href="#Table_I">Table I</a>.</p>

<p>The results given in <a href="#Table_I">Table I</a> represent the average of 12 tests.
Some of the pollen grains burst in pure water and in the weak cane
sugar solutions, the percentage of bursting being greatest in pure
water and decreasing as the percentage of sugar in the solution was
increased. There was considerable variation in the percentages of
germination in both water and in the solutions of different strengths,
and at times there was very little bursting which was not accompanied
by a high percentage of germination. The pollen tubes grew as
rapidly in water as in any of the sugar solutions, some reaching a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
length of 100 microns in six hours. As the pollen tubes made no
more growth in the solutions of sugar than in water, it is evident
that the sugar is not used as food, but helps in germination by reducing
the rate at which water is absorbed.</p>

<p>To judge from <a href="#Table_I">Table I</a>, the pollen of sweet clover can be effective
not only under ordinary conditions but also when the flowers are
wet with rain or dew or when the stigma is so dry that in order to
obtain water from the papillæ the pollen must overcome a high resistance
offered by the sap of the papillæ, a resistance that may be
equal to the osmotic pressure of a 45 per cent solution of cane sugar.
This is in accord with results obtained under field conditions; as
flowers that were pollinated while rain was falling set seed satisfactorily,
indicating that a high percentage of humidity in the atmosphere
does not check the germination of the pollen sufficiently to interfere
with fertilization. Neither was the setting of seed affected when the
soil about the roots of plants was kept saturated with water, showing
that the excessive quantity of water in the stigmas resulting from an
abundance of water in the soil did not interfere with the fertilization
of the flowers.</p>

<p>No definite counts were made of the germination of the pollen of
<i>Melilotus officinalis</i> in the solutions of cane sugar of different strengths,
but observations show that the moisture requirement of the pollen
of this species is approximately the same as that of <i>Melilotus alba</i>.</p>


<h3><a id="CROSS-POLLINATION"></a>CROSS-POLLINATION AND SELF-POLLINATION OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Results published by previous investigators on the cross-pollination
and self-pollination of sweet clover do not agree. The experiments
of Darwin (<a href="#lit_4">4</a>) show that the flowers are self-pollinated to
only a small extent. On the other hand, Kirchner (<a href="#lit_18">18</a>) and Kerner
(<a href="#lit_17">17</a>) find that self-pollination occurs generally and that cross-pollination
is not necessary for the production of seed. However, all
investigators agree that many different kinds of insects are able to
pollinate sweet clover.</p>

<p>Because of the diverse opinions as to the pollination of sweet clover,
a number of experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether
insect visitation was necessary to pollinate the flowers, (2) if necessary,
whether the flowers must be cross-pollinated, and (3) what
insects are active agents as pollinators of sweet clover.</p>

<h3><a id="ARTIFICIAL_MANIPULATION"></a>ARTIFICIAL MANIPULATION OF SWEET-CLOVER FLOWERS.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The writers wish to acknowledge their indebtedness to Mr. Carl Kurtzweil for assistance in conducting
part of the field experiments at Ames.</p></div>

<p>Experiments were conducted to determine, if possible, the effect
of various types of artificial manipulation of sweet-clover flowers
when in full bloom on the production of seed. Only healthy, vigorous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
plants growing on well-drained soil were selected for these experiments.
Before any of the flowers were open, the individual
racemes were covered with tarlatan and labeled. (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5.</a>) As soon
as part of the flowers opened, the racemes were uncovered and after
removing all flowers that were not open the open flowers were pollinated
and the racemes re-covered. If the flowers of sweet clover
are not fertilized they will remain open for two to three days, then
wither, and in a short time drop. But after being fertilized the ovules
enlarge very rapidly, and the corollas usually drop in about seven
or eight days. Therefore, all fertilized flowers can be distinguished
a few days after fertilization has taken place. Counts were made of
the number of pods which formed in 10 to 12 days after pollination.
An outline of the experiments is given in Table II.</p>

<p>As insects, and especially honeybees, usually visit all recently
opened flowers on a raceme, experiments C and D were conducted to
determine whether more seed would be produced when pollen from
other flowers on the same raceme was placed on the stigmas of the
flowers than when only the pollen produced by each flower was placed
on its own stigma. The effect of pollination when only the pollen
produced by an individual flower was placed on its own stigmas was
also obtained in experiment F, as by this method of pollination no
pollen was transferred from one flower to another. It can not be
stated definitely that the seed produced by the cross-pollinated
flowers was the result of fertilization with foreign pollen, as the
anthers were not removed from the flowers pollinated because it
would be necessary to remove the anthers when the flowers were not
more than two-thirds mature, and in doing this the flowers would be
so mutilated that only occasionally would pollination at this time
or at a later date be effective. The flowers listed in experiment E
were pollinated a short time before they opened, and in each case
pollen taken from flowers of other plants was placed on the stigmas.
The petals of the cross-pollinated flowers were not mutilated, and
in each case they returned to their original positions soon after pollination.
The results obtained in experiment B, where the racemes
were simply labeled and left open to the action of insects at all times,
serve for comparison with other experiments where the flowers were
protected from insect visitation and were artificially manipulated.</p>

<p>Martin (<a href="#lit_25">25</a>) found the setting of alfalfa seed and Westgate (<a href="#lit_40">40</a>)
found the setting of red-clover seed to be affected by an excessive
quantity of moisture in the soil or atmosphere. In order to overcome
the possible effect of this or of other detrimental factors, in
each experiment only the flowers on a certain number of racemes
were pollinated at one time. All of the experiments were repeated a
number of times during the months of July and August, 1916, and
the results given in <a href="#Table_III">Table III</a> show the total number of flowers pollinated
and the number of pods that formed during the two months.</p>

<p>The results presented in <a href="#Table_III">Table III</a> show that flowers fertilized
with pollen transferred from another plant produced a higher percentage
of pods than any of the other treatments. The results obtained
in experiment D, where the same toothpick was used to
spring the keels of all the flowers on a raceme, show that this method
of pollination produced an average of 7.24 pods per raceme more than
the racemes in experiment C. where a separate toothpick was used
for each flower. These results indicate that pollen transferred from
one flower to another on the same raceme is more effective than when
the pollen produced by an individual flower is used to fertilize its
own stigma. However, the results of experiment C prove that self-pollination
is effective in <i>Melilotus alba</i>. In experiment B. which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
was the open check, 4.3 per cent more flowers set seed than on the
racemes where the same toothpick was used to spring all the keels,
but 11.57 per cent more seed was obtained than in experiment C.
Spontaneous self-pollination occurs to only a very small extent, as
will be seen from the results of experiment A, in which an average of
only 2.9 per cent of the flowers set seed.</p>

<h3><a id="SEED_PRODUCTION"></a>SEED PRODUCTION OF MELILOTUS ALBA UNDER ORDINARY FIELD CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p>The production of seed of <i>Melilotus alba</i> under ordinary field conditions
varies considerably, not only in different parts of the country
but also on different fields in the same region. A number of factors
contribute to this variation, one of the most important of which
appears to be the inability of the plant to supply all the developing
seed with sufficient moisture, causing some of them to abort. As
pointed out on page 22 this condition was very marked in certain
parts of the country in 1916. However, poor seed production is
not always correlated with lack of moisture, for the seed crop was a
failure in 1915, where cloudy and rainy weather prevailed much of
the time the plants were in bloom. It is believed that the lack of
pollination by insects was the principal cause for the failure of seed to
set, as very few insects visit sweet-clover flowers when such conditions
prevail. As sweet-clover pollen will germinate in pure water
and as plants which have their roots submerged in water set seed
abundantly when pollinated, the failure of the seed crop in 1915 was
not due to excessive moisture.</p>

<p>As a rule, thin stands of sweet clover produce more seed to the
acre than thick stands and isolated plants more seed than those
growing in either a thick or thin stand. The correlation of seed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
production with the thickness of stand is probably due to the shading
and partial prevention of insect visitation to part of the racemes on
the lower branches. Most of the flowers upon the lower branches
of isolated plants are directly exposed to sunlight and to insect visits:
therefore the racemes on these branches produce as large a percentage
of seed as the racemes on the upper branches. In a thick
stand, little seed is produced by racemes on the lower branches.</p>

<p>A plant approximately 3 feet high growing close to the center of a
field at Arlington. Va., in which was an average stand of four sweet-clover
plants to the square foot was selected in order to determine
the number of racemes produced and the average number of seeds
to the raceme. This plant produced 196 racemes, which contained
an average of 20.4 pods each. The racemes varied from 2 to 10 cm.
in length, and the number of pods to the raceme ranged from to 75.
The racemes on the upper and most exposed portions of the plants
were larger and the flowers produced a much higher percentage of
pods than the racemes close to the bases of the larger branches.
Many of the small racemes on the lower branches produced less than
five pods each.</p>

<p>The data obtained from the two plants at Arlington that were
protected from night-flying insects may also be cited here, as the
results of that experiment show that night-flying insects are not an
important factor in the production of sweet-clover seed, and, further.
because they were growing under the same conditions, in the same
plat, and were approximately of the same size. These two plants
produced a total of 544 racemes, with an average of 20.9 pods each.
The number of pods to the raceme varied from to 86.</p>


<h3><a id="EFFICIENCY_POLLINATORS"></a>EFFICIENCY OF CERTAIN KINDS OF INSECTS AS POLLINATORS OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>In order further to test the self-sterility of sweet clover and to determine
the relative efficiency of night-flying and of different
kinds of day-flying insects as pollinators of the flowers, a number of
cages covered with cheesecloth, glass, or wire screen having 14
meshes to the linear inch were placed over plants at Arlington. Va.,
and at Ames. Iowa, in July and August. 1916. The bases of the
cages were buried several inches in the ground, so that insects could
not pass under them. Cheesecloth was used to cover most of the
cages and was made into sacks of such a size that they could be put
on or removed from the frames of the cages without difficulty. It
was stretched tightly over the frames and fastened to their bases
with laths.</p>

<p>A cage having two sides and the top of glass but with ends covered
with cheesecloth to permit ventilation was used at Ames to protect
a number of plants from insect visitation at all times. The purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
of this cage was to determine whether the partial shading of the
plants in the cages covered with cheesecloth would have any effect
upon the setting of seed.</p>

<p>The cage covered with wire netting having 14 meshes to the linear
inch was used to determine the efficiency as pollinators of sweet
clover of insects so small that they could pass through openings of
this size.</p>

<p>The plants used in the experiments at Arlington were growing
close to the center of a field of sweet clover. Volunteer plants in a
field that contained only a scattering stand were used at Ames. The
cages were placed over the plants in all of these experiments before
any of the flowers opened, and the work was continued until they
were through blooming.</p>

<h4>PLANTS SUBJECT TO INSECT VISITATION AT ALL TIMES.</h4>

<p>A plant subject to insect visits at all times and growing in the same
plat as those inclosed in the cages at Arlington was selected as a
check to those inclosed in the cages during their entire flowering
period or for only a portion of it. This plant, which was in bloom at
the same time as those inclosed in the cages, produced 196 racemes
with an average of 20.4 pods each. As all of the racemes were collected
and as those on the lower portions of the plant were smaller
than those on the upper branches, the average number of seeds per
raceme is much lower than it would have been if only the larger
racemes had been collected.</p>

<p>An isolated plant that was subject to insect visits at all times was
selected for a check to the cage work conducted at Ames. This was
necessary in order to get results that would be comparable with those
obtained from the plants inclosed in the cages, as the cage experiments
at Ames were conducted with isolated plants. The plant produced
239 racemes, with an average of 41.6 pods.</p>

<h4>PLANTS PROTECTED FROM INSECT VISITATION DURING THEIR ENTIRE FLOWERING
PERIOD.</h4>

<p>On July 3, 1916, a cage 3 feet square and 3&frac12; feet high, covered with
cheesecloth, was placed over three sweet-clover plants at Arlington.
(<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6.</a>) This cage was not opened until August 3, when practically
all of the racemes had passed the flowering stage and the few seeds
that formed on some of them were practically mature. The three
plants inclosed in the cage produced 904 racemes, with an average
of 0.63 pod each. No pods were produced on 594 racemes, while 150
produced but one each. None of the racemes produced more than
five pods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>This experiment was duplicated at Ames in August, 1916, with the
result that the three protected plants produced a total of 776 racemes,
with an average of 0.19 pod each.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp77" id="fig6" style="max-width: 18.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig6.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="fig_caption2"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Cage covered with cheesecloth to protect
plants from insect visitation.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The plants inclosed at Arlington produced 0.44 pod to the raceme
more than the plants inclosed at Ames, and the average for the six
plants at Arlington and at Ames is only 0.42 pod to the raceme.
Results given below for nine plants inclosed in the glass-covered cage
show that the pods
produced per raceme
by different plants
varied from 0.1 to
0.45, which is slightly
less than the variation
in the two cages
covered with cheese-cloth.</p>

<p>In order to determine
whether the
shading of the plants
in the cheesecloth-covered
cages had
caused the production
of seed to be reduced,
a cage 4 feet
wide, 4 feet high, and
10 feet long, having
glass sides and top,
but with ends covered with cheesecloth to permit ventilation, was
placed over nine plants at Ames in August, 1916. The results
obtained in this experiment are presented in <a href="#Table_IV">Table IV</a>.</p>

<p>The results given in <a href="#Table_IV">Table IV</a> show that an average of 0.31 of a
pod to the raceme was obtained from 1,594 racemes and that the
variation in seed production of the different plants was from 0.1 to
0.45 to the raceme. The average seed production for the nine plants
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
is 0.11 seed to the raceme less than the average results obtained from
the six plants that were covered with cheesecloth. As this difference
is well within the limit of variation for individual plants, it may be
stated that the shading of the plants in the cheesecloth-covered cages
did not reduce the production of seed. The results of this experiment
show that spontaneous self-pollination does not occur regularly, as
stated by Kirchner.</p>

<h4>FLOWERS POLLINATED ONLY BY NIGHT-FLYING INSECTS.</h4>

<p>In order to determine the importance of night-flying insects as
pollinators, two cheesecloth-covered cages 3 feet square and 3&frac12; feet
high were placed over sweet-clover plants at Arlington on July 10,
1916. The covers of the cages were removed each evening at 7:30
and replaced each morning at 4:30 o'clock. Practically all the
flowers on these plants had bloomed by August 2, and the seed produced
was nearly mature. The few racemes that contained opened
flowers or buds were discarded. The three plants in one cage produced
723 racemes, with an average of 3.76 pods each, while the one
plant in the other cage produced 227 racemes, with an average of
3.58 pods to the raceme. The four plants, therefore, produced a
total of 950 racemes, with an average of 3.71 pods each. The only
night-flying insect found working on sweet clover while these plants
were in bloom was <i>Diacrisia virginica</i> Fabr.</p>

<p>This experiment was duplicated at Ames in August, 1916, with the
result that one plant subject to visitation only by night-flying insects
produced 486 racemes, with an average of 16.5 pods each.</p>

<p>The results obtained in these experiments show that night-flying
insects were much more active in pollinating sweet clover at Ames
than at Arlington. However, as the results obtained from the plants
subject to visitation by day-flying insects only were practically the
same as those obtained from plants which were subject to insect
visitation at all times, it is concluded that night-flying insects were
not a factor in the pollination of sweet clover at Arlington or at Ames
in 1916.</p>

<h4>FLOWERS POLLINATED ONLY BY DAY-FLYING INSECTS.</h4>

<p>A cheesecloth-covered cage, 3 feet square and 3&frac12; feet high, was
placed on July 7, 1916, over two sweet-clover plants at Arlington,
before any of the flowers opened. As the cover of this cage was
removed at 7.30 a. m. and replaced at 4.30 p. m. each day during the
experiment, the plants were subject to visitation by day-flying
insects only. As soon as all of the flowers on most of the racemes had
bloomed, and before any mature pods shattered, the racemes were
removed from the plants and the pods produced by each raceme
counted. The two plants produced a total of 544 racemes, with an
average of 20.9 pods each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>This experiment was also conducted at Ames. One plant was
protected from insect visitation at night in August, 1916, with the
result that it produced 418 racemes, with an average of 41.11 pods
each.</p>

<h4>PLANTS PROTECTED FROM ALL INSECTS THAT COULD NOT PASS THROUGH A WIRE
SCREEN HAVING 14 MESHES TO THE LINEAR INCH.</h4>

<p>It is well known that many small insects, and especially those
belonging to the family Syrphidæ and to the genus Halictus, frequent
sweet-clover flowers, but no records have been noted that show how
important these insects are as pollinators of this plant. In order to
obtain data on this subject a cage 12 feet square and 6&frac12; feet high,
made of wire screen having 14 meshes to the linear inch, was placed
over a few plants at Ames, in July, 1916, before they began to bloom.
The base of the cage was buried several inches in the soil, so that no
insects could get into it. As these plants were growing in a field
where there was a sufficient supply of moisture at all times, they made
a growth of 5 to 6 feet. For this reason all the racemes were collected
from only a portion of one of the plants instead of from the entire
plant, as was done with the smaller ones inclosed in the cheesecloth-covered
cages. The branches selected contained 224 racemes, with
an average of 24.53 pods each. Many insects that were able to pass
through the wire netting were observed working on the flowers of the
inclosed plants.</p>

<p>A check plant, subject to visitation by all insects and growing
within a few yards of the cage, contained 264 racemes, with an average
of 28.23 pods each.</p>

<p>This experiment shows that small insects are efficient pollinators
of sweet clover and that the plant to which all insects had access
produced an average of only 3.7 pods to the raceme more than the
one inclosed in the cage. As these plants were growing close to a
strip of timber and some distance from a field of sweet clover, it is
probable that more small insects worked on the flowers than would
have been the case if the cage had been located in the center of a
field of sweet clover. Though these results show that small insects
are able to pollinate sweet-clover flowers freely, it is very doubtful
whether insects of this kind would be numerous enough to pollinate
sufficient flowers in a large field of sweet clover for profitable seed
production. The honeybee is the most efficient pollinator of this
plant, and it is believed that in many sections it is responsible for the
pollination of more than half of the flowers.</p>

<p>The results in <a href="#Table_V">Table V</a> show that an average of 0.37 pod to the
raceme was obtained from the plants protected from visitation by all
insects during the flowering period. As the racemes of <i>Melilotus
alba</i> will average approximately 50 flowers each, less than 1 per cent
of them set seed without being pollinated by insects. The results
obtained in the cages in which only night-flying insects had access to
the flowers show that these insects pollinate sweet clover to a slight
extent, but that the number of pods produced by them is so few that
it may be assumed that these flowers would have been pollinated by
day-flying insects. This assumption is borne out by the results
obtained in the cages where only day-flying insects had access to the
flowers, as the results obtained in these cages at Arlington and Ames,
respectively, are approximately the same as those obtained on the
plants subject to insect visitation at all times. It will be noted that
the yield of seed on the plants visited by insects at Ames is much
higher than that of the plants subjected to insect visits during the
same period at Arlington. This difference in seed yield may be
attributed to the fact that isolated plants were used in the experiments
at Ames, and at Arlington the experiments were conducted
with plants growing under field conditions.</p>


<h3><a id="RELATION_OF_THE_POSITION"></a>RELATION OF THE POSITION OF THE FLOWERS ON MELILOTUS ALBA
PLANTS TO SEED PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Observations of sweet-clover plants grown under cultivation, and
especially when the stands were thick, showed that the flowers of the
racemes on the upper and exposed branches produced a larger percentage
of seed than those on the lower branches which were less
exposed. It is thought by some that the failure of the flowers on the
lower racemes to be fertilized is due to shading; but the results obtained
in the cheesecloth and glass covered cages do not warrant this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
belief, as it is doubtful whether the shading of the flowers on the
lower racemes is more than that caused by the cheesecloth. It is
probably the lack of pollination that causes this decrease in seed production
on the lower branches of plants growing close together, as a
vast number of flowers open each day on portions of the plants which
are exposed directly to visitation by insects and are therefore more
accessible to them.</p>

<p>In order to obtain information upon the number of flowers that
produce seed on the upper and lower portions, respectively, of sweet-clover
plants when grown under field conditions and where the stand
contained four to five plants to the square foot, a number of racemes
were labeled on different portions of the plants at Ames in 1915 and
1916. When the pods were partly mature, records were made of the
number of flowers that produced pods. The results obtained are
given in <a href="#Table_VI">Table VI</a>.</p>

<p>The flowers on the upper racemes of the plants produced 31.2 per
cent more pods than those on the lower racemes in 1915. and 11.4 per
cent more in 1916. These results prove that insects more frequently
visit the flowers that are directly exposed and are therefore more
accessible.</p>

<h3><a id="INFLUENCE_WEATHER"></a>INFLUENCE OF THE WEATHER AT BLOSSOMING TIME UPON SEED PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The seed production of sweet clover is seldom satisfactory when
rainy or muggy weather prevails during the flowering period. In
order to obtain data as to the relation existing between the visits of
insects and the prevailing weather conditions, a record of insect visits
and of the number of flowers that opened each day was kept for a
period of nine days at Ames in August, 1915.</p>

<p>In this experiment the racemes were marked early each morning
just above the last flowers which had opened the previous day, and
early the following morning the number of flowers which had opened
the previous day was noted. The number of flowers that were pollinated
was determined by the number of pods that formed. <a href="#Table_VII">Table
VII</a> gives in detail the results obtained.</p>

pollination is much higher in clear weather, when insects are active,
than in cloudy or rainy weather, when but few insects visit the

<h3><a id="INSECT_POLLINATORS"></a>INSECT POLLINATORS OF SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<p>On account of the ease with which the heavy flow of nectar of
sweet-clover flowers may be obtained many insects visit the flowers,
thereby pollinating them. While the useful insect visitors of flowers
of red clover are limited to a few species of Hymenoptera, those
pollinating sweet-clover blossoms are many and belong to such
orders as Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, as well as to the
Hymenoptera. However, in the United States the honeybee is the
most important pollinator of sweet clover. In many parts of the
country the different species of Halictus, commonly known as sweat
bees, rank next in importance. The margined soldier beetles
(<i>Chauliognathus marginatus</i> Fabr.) were very active pollinators at
Arlington, Va., in the latter part of June and first part of July, 1916,
but the woolly bear (<i>Diacrisia virginica</i> Fabr.) was the only night-flying
insect found working on sweet clover at Arlington.</p>

<p>Insects belonging to the genera Halictus, Syritta, and Paragus
were very active pollinators at Ames, Iowa, in 1916, and ranked
next in importance to the honeybee. In fact, the results obtained
in the cage where the plants were protected from visitation by
insects that could not pass through a screen having 14 meshes to
the linear inch showed that these small insects were able under
the conditions of that experiment to pollinate practically as many
flowers as larger insects.</p>

<p>The insects listed below were collected while visiting <i>Melilotus
alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i> flowers in 1916.</p>

<h3><a id="EFFECT_OF_MOISTURE"></a>EFFECT OF MOISTURE UPON THE PRODUCTION OF MELILOTUS ALBA SEED.</h3>

<p>Careful inspection of a number of sweet-clover fields in Iowa and
Illinois in the autumn of 1916 indicated that many plants were
unable to obtain sufficient moisture for the proper development of
their flowers. Examination of flowers that aborted shortly after
reaching their mature size showed that the anther sacs had not
burst, even though the pollen grains were mature. Apparently for
the same reason many immature pods aborted. The precipitation
for July, 1916, in Livingston County, Ill., where the sweet-clover
seed crop suffered materially for lack of moisture, was 3.2 inches less
than normal, while the temperature was 4.5° F. above normal. In
August the precipitation was 0.96 of an inch below normal and the
temperature 4.2° F. above normal. At Ames, Iowa, the precipitation
was 3.54 inches below normal and the temperature 5.4° F. above
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
normal in July. Both the precipitation and temperature were about
normal at Ames in August, but most of the precipitation fell before
the experiments were commenced.</p>

<p>In north-central Illinois the seed production of sweet clover was
very irregular. Some fields produced an abundance of seed, while a
large percentage of the pods on the plants in other fields near by,
where the thickness of the stand, size of the plants, and conditions
in general were approximately the same, aborted. It was evident
that all stands producing a good seed crop were growing on well-drained
soil and that those which were not yielding satisfactorily
were on poorly drained land. It is well known that sweet clover
will produce deep taproots only when the plants are growing in
well-drained soil and that a much-branched surface root system will
be formed on poorly drained land, and especially when there is an
excess of moisture or a high water table during the first season's
growth. During this droughty period in 1916 the upper layer of soil
became so depleted of moisture that the plants with surface root
systems were unable to obtain sufficient water to mature their seed.
On the other hand, the lack of precipitation and the high temperatures
did not affect the moisture content of the subsoil sufficiently
to interfere with the normal seed production of deep-rooted plants.
According to Lutts (<a href="#lit_22">22</a>, p. 47) this same condition was found to be
true in Ohio in 1916.</p>

<p>As a rule, under droughty conditions the second crop of sweet
clover will produce a higher yield of seed than the first crop, as the
second growth of the plants is seldom more than half as much as the
first, thereby requiring less moisture. However, if showery hot
weather prevails when the first crop is cut, the end of each stub is
very apt to become infected, usually with a species of Fusarium,
which kills all the cortex as far back as the upper bud or young shoot
and that part of it on the opposite side of this bud to the bud below.
If the second bud from the top of a stub is not directly opposite the
upper one the decay may extend nearly to the ground. (<a href="#plate4">Pl. IV.</a>)
The destruction of half to two-thirds of the cortex from 2 to 4 inches
below the upper bud materially reduces the quantity of water that
can be conveyed to the branch above the base of the dead area.
Plants thus infected obtain sufficient moisture for seed production
only under the most favorable conditions. When the first crop is
cut during warm dry weather, and especially when the first crop has
not been permitted to make more than a 30 to 32 inch growth, the
stubble seldom decays, and in no instance have the plants been
observed to decay as far back as the upper buds.</p>

<p>An experiment was conducted at Ames in the latter part of August
and first part of September, 1916, to determine the effect of watering
plants that were aborting a large percentage of their flowers and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
immature pods. For this purpose several volunteer plants growing
in a meadow were selected. A hole 12 inches square and 14 inches
deep was dug 8 inches from the crown of one plant, and each evening
during the experiment 2 gallons of water were poured into the hole.
The top of the hole was kept covered, so as to check evaporation from
it as much as possible. Another plant of the same size and growing
about 15 yards from the watered plant served as a check. On both
plants many of the flowers and immature buds were aborting at the
beginning of the experiment. The soil in this field was so depleted
of moisture that the leaves of the plants wilted during the hottest
part of the days preceding the experiment. The foliage on the check
plant wilted each day for the first five days of the experiment. On the
sixth day 0.96 of an inch of rain fell and four days later 0.23 of an
inch more. The dropping of the flowers was temporarily checked by
these precipitations, but owing to the dry, compact condition of the
soil the rain was not sufficient to check entirely the fall of flowers and
immature pods. At the beginning of the experiment the racemes on
both plants were divided into three classes, according to the development
of the flowers, and labeled. They were collected and the seeds
counted as soon as the pods at the bases of the racemes commenced
to turn brown. <a href="#Table_VIII">Table VIII</a> presents the results obtained.</p>

<p>The effect of the water was noticeable soon after the first application,
as the leaves and flowers on this plant became turgid and the
anther sacs burst at the proper stage of their development. Very
few flowers fell after the second day. The water decidedly checked
the aborting of immature pods, as is shown by the results obtained
on the racemes which were labeled after the pods had formed. The
racemes which contained pods 3 to 6 days old when labeled matured
9.95 pods to the raceme more than those which contained older pods
at the beginning of the experiment, but this was expected, as most
of the aborting which caused this difference had taken place before
the racemes were labeled. As very few pods aborted before they
were 3 to 6 days old, the difference of 9.95 pods to the raceme in favor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
of the ones labeled when the flowers at their bases were just ready to
open was largely due to the dropping of the flowers on the older
racemes before the experiment was begun.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the production of mature pods on the plant
not watered was much greater on the racemes that were labeled
before the flowers opened than on the older racemes. This difference
is undoubtedly due to the precipitation which fell on the sixth and
tenth days of the experiment. It is believed that the yield of 15.23
pods to the raceme on the ones labeled when the pods were 9 to 12
days old is representative of the production of pods per raceme previous
to the precipitation and that the other racemes on this plant
would have yielded proportionately if conditions had remained the
same.</p>

<p>In the early spring of 1916, <i>Melilotus alba</i> was planted in several
large pots in the greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture at
Washington, D. C. These pots were placed outside the greenhouse
in the late spring, where they remained until the following January,
when they were taken into the greenhouse. The plants grew rapidly
and began to flower during the latter part of April, 1917. At this
time two pots were placed in a large cage made of screen having 20
meshes to the linear inch. One pot was submerged in a tub of water,
so that the soil was saturated at all times, while the plant in the other
pot was given only sufficient water to keep it from wilting. The
pods on a few racemes were self-pollinated and the results obtained
are given in Table IX.</p>

<h3><a id="HISTORICAL_SUMMARY"></a>HISTORICAL SUMMARY.</h3>

<p>When agriculturists first began to cultivate wild legumes they
observed that many seeds would not germinate within a comparatively
short time after planting. Thus the problem of impermeable
seeds began to demand attention many years ago. However, impermeable
seeds are not confined to the Leguminosæ, as they occur also
in the Malvaceæ, Chenopodiaceæ, Convolvulaceæ, Cannaceæ, and
other families.</p>

<p>Since the first account of the structure of legume seed coats by
Malpighi (<a href="#lit_23">23</a> v. 1) in 1687, many investigators have contributed to
our knowledge of the structure of the coats of seeds belonging to this
family.</p>

<p>Pammel (<a href="#lit_31">31</a>) made an extensive study of legume seeds, including
all the genera in the sixth edition of Gray's Manual, as well as
genera not included in that publication. He found that the seed coat
uniformly consisted of three layers, namely, the outer layer of Malpighian
cells, the osteosclerid layer, and the inner layer of nutrient
cells. Pammel's work included a study of the seed coats of <i>Melilotus
alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i>, and the descriptions and illustrations in
his publication agree for the most part with the results obtained in
the investigations reported in this article. However, more variation
was noticed in the different layers of the seed coat than he describes.</p>

<p>The cause of impermeability in seeds has been investigated by
many. It has been found to be due to the embryos in some seeds,
such as the hawthorns, but in most cases to the structure of the seed
coat, and especially so in the Leguminosæ. Crocker (<a href="#lit_3">3</a>) states that,
exactly opposite to the common view, the cause of delayed germination
generally lies in the seed coats rather than in the embryos.
Nobbe (<a href="#lit_29">29</a>) thought that the hardness of leguminous seeds was due
to the Malpighian layer, and in a later publication Nobbe and Haenlein
(<a href="#lit_30">30</a>, p. 81) state that the absorbent power of many seeds is inhibited
or entirely arrested by the cones of the Malpighian cells and the
shields built up between them, which consist principally of cutin.
Huss (<a href="#lit_15">15</a>) agrees with Nobbe and Haenlein. Verschaffelt (<a href="#lit_39">39</a>)
found that the impermeability of the seeds of Cæsalpiniaceæ and
Mimosaceæ investigated was due to, the inability of water to pass
through the canals of the seed coat. By soaking the seeds in alcohol
or other substances which change the capillarity of the pores, the seed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
coats were made readily permeable to water. Gola (<a href="#lit_6">6</a>) states that
the cause of the impermeability of seeds is the peculiar character of
the Malpighian cells, which prevents their infiltration and consequent
increase in volume, while Bergtheil and Day (<a href="#lit_2">2</a>) found that the
hardness of the seeds of <i>Indigofera arrecta</i> was due to their possession
of a very thin outer covering of a substance resistant to water.
Ewart (<a href="#lit_5">5</a>, p. 185) believes that in most impermeable seeds the cuticle
prohibits the absorption of water, but gives as an exception <i>Adansonia
digitata</i>, in which the whole integument seems to be permeable to
water with difficulty. The following is quoted from White (<a href="#lit_42">42</a>, p.
205):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smaller">As a general rule in small and medium-sized seeds the cuticle is well developed
and represents the impermeable part of the seed coat, while in the cases of large seeds,
such as those of <i>Adansonia gregorii</i>, <i>Mucuna gigantea</i>, <i>Wistaria maideniana</i>, and <i>Guilandina
bonducella</i>, the cuticle is relatively unimportant and inconspicuous. In these
seeds the extreme resistance which they exhibit appears to be located in the palisade
cells.</p></div>

<p>In discussing the seed coat of <i>Melilotus alba</i>, Rees (<a href="#lit_33">33</a>, p. 404)
states that the outer layer consists of palisade cells covered, externally
by a structureless membrane, which, however, did not appear
to be cuticle but hemicellulose, as it stained magenta with chloriodid
of zinc. The greater part of the walls of the palisade cells also
appears to be composed of hemicellulose and the outer ends only
were cuticularized. In order to find whether the outer membrane
was in itself impermeable to water, this author treated seeds for short
intervals in sulphuric acid to dissolve the outside covering without
directly affecting the palisade cells. Seeds treated in this manner
swelled in water and microscopic examination showed that the ends
of the palisade cells were quite intact, but had separated from each
other. From this it was concluded that the outer membrane is
instrumental in conferring impermeability on the seed, although not
directly responsible for it, as is the case with a true cuticle. It is
further believed that it probably served as a cement substance by
means of which the cuticularized ends of the cells were held together
closely, thus forming a barrier through which water could not penetrate,
but that as soon as this barrier was removed the ends of the
palisade cells separated and water passed in between them.</p>

<p>More than 20 years ago machines were devised by Kuntze, Michalowski
(<a href="#lit_27">27</a>, p. 86), Huss (<a href="#lit_15">15</a>), and later by Hughes (<a href="#lit_14">14</a>), to scarify
impermeable seeds. Other methods have been recommended and
employed to some extent for hastening the germination of seeds.
Hiltner (<a href="#lit_13">13</a>, p. 44) treated seeds of red clover, white clover, and
alfalfa 10, 30, and 60 minutes with concentrated sulphuric acid and
found that the best germination resulted from the 60-minute treatment.
Love and Leighty (<a href="#lit_21">21</a>) also treated the seeds of various
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
legumes with concentrated sulphuric acid and obtained a better
germination in all cases. In their investigations with <i>Melilotus alba</i>
it was found that a 2-hour treatment resulted in some injury to the
seed, but that a treatment varying from 25 minutes to 1 hour gave
good results. In most cases in our investigations the seed coats
of sweet clover became permeable to water after a treatment of
15 minutes in concentrated sulphuric acid, and within 5 minutes all
of the Malpighian cells were destroyed down to the light line. Harrington
(<a href="#lit_10">10</a>) found that the soil, season, climate, color, or size of
red-clover seeds had no influence upon the percentage of impermeable
seeds and that the good germination ordinarily obtained with red
clover was due to the scarifying of the seed coats by the rasps of
hulling machines. Harrington (<a href="#lit_11">11</a>) also studied the agricultural
value of impermeable seeds and found that alternations of temperature
cause the softening and germinating of many impermeable
clover seeds when a temperature of 10° C. or cooler is used in alternation
with a temperature of 20° C. or warmer and that the effect
of such an alternation of temperature is greatly increased by previously
exposing the seeds to germinating conditions at a temperature
of 10° C. or cooler and is decreased by previously exposing the seeds
to germinating conditions at a temperature of 30° C. It is a well-known
fact that impermeable seeds which remain in the field over
winter germinate readily the following spring.</p>

<p>The light line is the most important and interesting feature of the
Malpighian cell, at least so far as <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i> are
concerned. But one light line occurs in the Malpighian cells in
most Leguminosæ, although Pammel (<a href="#lit_32">32</a>) reports two well-developed
light lines in <i>Gymnocladus canadensis</i>, Junowicz (<a href="#lit_16">16</a>) found three in
<i>Lupinus varius</i>, and Sempolowski (<a href="#lit_36">36</a>) two in <i>Lupinus angustifolius</i>.</p>

<p>Many investigators have studied the light line, and different
theories have been advanced as to its function, physical properties,
and chemical nature. Schleiden and Vogel (<a href="#lit_35">35</a>, p. 26) in describing
the mature testa of <i>Schizolobium excelsum</i> in 1838 undoubtedly referred
to the light line when they stated that the walls of the Malpighian
cells were not equally thickened. Mettenius (<a href="#lit_26">26</a>), in 1846, was
probably the first definitely to describe the light line. This author
believed it was composed of pore canals, all appearing at the same
height in the cells, but he was unable to prove this by cross sections.
Lohde (<a href="#lit_20">20</a>) studied the light line in seeds of <i>Hibiscus trionum</i> and
found it cutinized. Hanstein (<a href="#lit_8">8</a>) states that the Malpighian cells are
composed of two cell layers and the light line is produced by the
adjoining walls of the ends of the cells. Later, this same author (<a href="#lit_9">9</a>),
according to Harz (<a href="#lit_12">12</a>), refers to the light line as a perforated disk
composed of tissue of strong refracting power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Russow (<a href="#lit_34">34</a>) concludes that the light line is produced by neither
chemical nor mechanical changes but is caused by a modified molecular
structure containing less water than the remainder of the cell
wall. Hiltner (<a href="#lit_13">13</a>) agrees with Russow's explanation. Harz (<a href="#lit_12">12</a>,
p. 561) also agrees with Russow and adds that he has observed that
the light line disappeared in a number of cases after applications of
nitric acid. Wigand and Dennert (<a href="#lit_43">43</a>) suggested that the light line
is due to a series of erect fissures, while Tietz (<a href="#lit_37">37</a>, p. 32) believes it is
due to a chemical modification and that the phenomenon results
from the exceptionally extreme density of parts of the cellulose
membrane. Junowicz (<a href="#lit_16">16</a>) found evidence of cellulose material.
The cell wall at this point was strongly refractive and had a different
molecular structure. After studying <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>, Haberlandt
(<a href="#lit_7">7</a>, p. 38) agrees with the Russow explanation. In the seed of this
plant the light line colored blue after being treated with chloriodid
of zinc. Sempolowski (<a href="#lit_36">36</a>), who investigated the light line in <i>Lupinus
angustifolius</i>, states that there is not only a difference in the molecular
structure but also a chemical modification of the cell wall at this
point, since with iodin and sulphuric acid the cell wall colored blue,
whereas the light line colored yellow. Wettstein (<a href="#lit_41">41</a>), who studied
seeds of Nelumbo, agrees with Russow (<a href="#lit_34">34</a>) and Sempolowski (<a href="#lit_36">36</a>)
that chemical and physical modifications occur. He found that iodin
and sulphuric acid colored the Malpighian cells intensely blue, the
light line at first yellowish, and then later it gradually became blue.
This reaction may be accelerated by heat. Iodin produced the same
effect, and the light line colored blue more rapidly. When treated
with a water-withdrawing medium the light line was not altered for
some time, but finally disappeared with continued application.
Cooking for a long time in caustic potash or standing in cold caustic
potash caused the cells to swell, while the light line remained uninjured
at first but finally disappeared. He also believed that the
absence of pore canals in the region of the light line caused it to be
more dense.</p>

<p>Nobbe and Haenlein (<a href="#lit_30">30</a>) treated sections of seed coats of <i>Trifolium
pratense</i> with iodin and sulphuric acid and found that the light line
colored blue as readily as the thickened ridges that radiate inward
from it, but that the outer processes of the palisade cells projecting
from the light line toward the cuticle stained dark brown. They also
state that various causes work to produce such unusual lusters in
the light line, the principle one of which is the thickened ridges which
radiate inward, reach their greatest development at this point, and
coalesce in the lumen of the cell. The result is that the light line
falls upon a continuously homogeneous medium, while in the inner
portions of the ridges the light passes through media of varying
opacity, such as cellulose, water, and protoplasm, whereby it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
progressively subdued in varying degrees by partial reflection. Pammel
(<a href="#lit_31">31</a>, p. 147) studied the light line in <i>Melilotus alba</i> and found that it
consisted of a narrow but distinct refractive zone below the conical
layer. The refractive zone colored blue with chloriodid of zinc.
The whole upper part was, however, more or less refractive, while the
remainder of the cell wall contained pigment and colored blue with
chloriodid of zinc. Small canals project into the walls, in some
cases extending beyond the light line.</p>

<p>Beck (<a href="#lit_1">1</a>) found that the light-refracting power of the light line was
much greater than that of the undifferentiated membrane and stated
that there may be in addition to this a chemical difference which can
not be detected with the present microchemical methods. He does
not believe that it is cuticularized or that it contains less water than
the rest of the cell.</p>

<p>Marlière (<a href="#lit_24">24</a>, p. 11) gives a physical explanation and states that the
true cause of the light line lies in the peculiar structure of the secondary
membrane of the Malpighian cell. Tunmann (<a href="#lit_38">38</a>, p. 559)
observed that it did not hydrolize in weak acids and therefore decided
that it was not hemicellulose. He found that it dissolved in concentrated
sulphuric acid more readily than the regions surrounding it
and that it was composed of pectin or callose. In our investigations
the main portion of the light line of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i>
was very resistant to concentrated sulphuric acid, only the narrow
outer portion being attacked. It showed evidence of callose.</p>


<h3><a id="MATERIAL_AND_METHODS"></a>MATERIAL AND METHODS.</h3>

<p>Permeable and impermeable seeds<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i>
were obtained from commercial samples and also from samples
collected in the field. Those selected for sectioning were allowed
to dry after being removed from the germinator and then embedded
on the ends of pine blocks in glycerin gum, which was made by
dissolving 10 grams of powdered gum arabic in 10 c. c. of water and
adding 40 drops of glycerin. After the glycerin gum had dried
for 24 hours, the seeds were easily sectioned. This method of embedding
causes no change in the seed coat. It is more satisfactory
than the paraffin method for holding the seeds firmly. The glycerin
gum dissolved readily when the sections were mounted in water.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> The term "permeable" is used in this paper to designate seeds whose coats are permeable to water in
two weeks or less at temperatures favorable for germination, while the term "impermeable" is used to
designate seeds whose seed coats are impermeable to water for this length of time when temperatures are
favorable for germination. Impermeable seeds are commonly referred to as "hard seeds," and they may
become permeable in time.</p></div>

<p>In the microchemical studies Sudan III, alcanin, chlorophyll solution,
and phosphoric acid iodin were used to test for cutin or suberin;
sulphuric acid and iodin, chloriodid of zinc, and chloriodid of
calcium for cellulose; phloroglucin and hydrochloric acid for lignin;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
ruthenium red for pectic substances; and sulphuric acid, Congo red,
and aniline blue for callose.</p>

<p>Where very thin sections were necessary for detailed study of the
structure of the seed coat, pods in various stages of development
were collected, and after the usual preliminary treatment they were
embedded in paraffin and sectioned with the microtome. Microchemical
tests were made with these sections by using various specific
stains. Safranin was used to test for cutin, suberin, and lignin;
haematoxylin and methyl blue for cellulose ; methylene blue, methyl
violet B, mauvein, and ruthenium red for pectic substances; and
aniline blue and Congo red for callose. In studying some points
with reference to the pore system of the seed coat, it was necessary
to use free-hand sections of fresh pods.</p>

<p>In studying the seed coat in relation to the absorption of water,
both permeable and impermeable seeds were soaked in water solutions
of safranin, gentian violet, eosin, and haematoxylin, then dried
and embedded in glycerin gum for sectioning. Seeds were soaked
in stains dissolved in 95 per cent alcohol to test the penetration of
alcohol. It was evident that the seed coats did not act as a filter,
as the stains passed through them with the water or alcohol.</p>


<h3><a id="STRUCTURE_SEED_COAT"></a>STRUCTURE OF THE SEED COAT.</h3>

<p>There is very little endosperm present in mature seeds of <i>Melilotus
alba</i> or <i>M. officinalis</i>. That which is present is quite permeable to
water and therefore bears no relation to the impermeable seeds of
these plants.</p>

<p>The outer layer of the seed coat, which is the modified epidermal
layer of the ovule, is known as the Malpighian layer. (<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, figs. 1
and 2.</a>) The cells constituting this layer, commonly called palisade
cells, are the most highly modified cells of the seed coat. They are
very much elongated, their length varying in the different regions of
the coat, and their outer tangential walls and the outer portions of
their radial walls are so much thickened that their lumina are confined
to the inner portion of the cells, sometimes occupying less than
half the length of the cells. The inner tangential walls and inner
portions of the radial walls are thickened just previous to the death
of the cells, the thickening sometimes being only slight and sometimes
so much as to leave only very narrow lumina.</p>

<p>There is a very thin layer on the outer surface of the Malpighian
cells which has been called cuticle by previous investigators, but the
chemical composition of this layer and its perviousness to water
indicate that there is very little cutin present. This layer is probably
the primary epidermal cell wall rather than a deposit on the outer
surface of the wall. To determine this a study of the development
of the Malpighian cells is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Beneath the so-called cuticle there is the much thickened outer
portion of the Malpighian cells in which there are two rather distinct
regions, one constituting the conelike structures and the other forming
a continuous layer over the conelike structures, separating them
from the cuticle and filling in between them. These two regions
separate easily, and in cutting sections the outer region, called by
some the cuticularized portion, often breaks away, leaving the entire
surface of the cones exposed.</p>

<p>The term "cuticularized layer" will be used to designate all of the
thickening covering the cones, including that around the cones as
well as the portion between the cones and the cuticle. This term is
not entirely appropriate, for the region is practically free from cutin,
but for the want of a better term it will be used. There are canals in
the cuticularized layer and cones, which are easily seen when the
sections are treated with chloriodid of zinc or sulphuric acid. A
surface view of a section showing the cones and cuticularized layer
when mounted in glycerin shows the canals as dark lines due to the
air inclosed. The canals are most abundant along the lines where
the lateral walls of the cells join, but many are within the cones and
in the cuticularized substance between the cones. (<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 5.</a>)</p>

<p>The well-developed light line in <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i> is
found just below the bases of the cones. In some seed coats only a
few and in others none of the canals which are common in the cones
and cuticularized region cross the light line. A very distinct line of
small canals filled with air and thus forming a dark band is present
just above the fight line, thus making the light line more conspicuous.
(<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 3.</a>) When the lumina of the cells extend across the light
line, they are exceedingly small. The light line is the most compact
region of the Malpighian layer and is conspicuous because it refracts
the light much more than the regions above and below it.</p>

<p>Just below the Malpighian is a layer of cells variously modified
and known as the osteosclerid. The cells of this layer are often
referred to as the hourglass cells on account of their shape. In some
regions of the seed coat they are expanded at both ends and their
walls are much thickened, the thickenings forming ridges on the
radial walls, while in other regions only the upper tangential wall and
a portion of the radial walls are thickened and the cells are expanded
only at the inner end, thus having the shape of the frustum of a cone.
Beneath the osteosclerid layer is the nutrient layer.</p>

<p>The nutrient layer contains chloroplasts. It varies not only in
the number of layers of cells composing it, but also in the modifications
of these cells. This layer ranges from four to seven cells in
thickness in the different parts of the seed coat.</p>

<h3><a id="MICROCHEMISTRY"></a>MICROCHEMISTRY OF THE SEED COAT.</h3>

<p>Tests for cutin showed that there was very little present in the
seed coat. Slight reactions for cutin were observed in the cuticle, in
the outer margin of the cuticularized layer, and in the basal portion
of the cones. These reactions were so slight as to be almost negligible.
It is evident that the cuticle and cuticularized layer are not
well named in <i>Melilotus alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i>. Tests for cellulose
showed that it was present in the cuticle, cuticularized layer, cones,
the walls of the Malpighian cells below the light line, and the walls of
the cells of the osteosclerid and nutrient layers. (<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 9.</a>)
The reaction for cellulose in the Malpighian cells was quite distinct in
the walls below the light line, less distinct in the cones and cuticle,
and least distinct in the cuticularized layer.</p>

<p>Tests for lignin occasionally showed slight traces in the Malpighian
cells below the light line. When treated with reagents for pectic substances,
the cuticle, cuticularized layer, cones, and all cell walls
below the light line gave a definite reaction. The reaction of the
cones and cuticle was more pronounced than the cuticularized layer.
Tests for callose gave no reaction except in the upper part of the
light line. This part of the light line stained slightly blue with
aniline blue and was easily dissolved with sulphuric acid. In cutting
free-hand sections of fresh material the Malpighian layer sometimes
broke along this line. The greater part of the light line reacted to
none of the tests, and its chemical nature was not determined.</p>

<p>When microtome sections of seeds in different stages of development
were treated with various stains, the results were in accord
with those obtained with free-hand sections. Thus with safranin
the periphery and cones of the Malpighian cells were slightly stained,
while haematoxylin and methyl blue stained all the seed coat except
the light line. The cones and cuticle stained more readily than the
cuticularized layer, but neither stained as deeply as the cell walls
below the light line. Methylene blue, methyl violet B, and mauvein
stained all above the light line, indicating the presence of pectic substances;
however, the staining was more prominent in the cones and
cuticle.</p>

<p>The difference in reaction of the cones and cuticularized layer to
the cellulose and pectose tests probably indicates a difference in
density rather than a difference in chemical composition. Since the
cuticularized layer separates readily from the cones, there may be a
difference in physical properties.</p>

<p>With Congo red the upper part of the light line was only very
slightly stained, but aniline blue had a more pronounced effect.</p>

<p>The microchemical tests applied to the seed coat show that in the
region above the light line there is only a slight trace of cutin or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
suberin, but a considerable amount of cellulose and pectose. All
cell walls below the light line are mainly cellulose but contain some
pectose. The upper portion of the light line contains callose, but
the remainder of the light line appears to be chemically different
from all other parts of the seed coat or else so dense as to resist the
attack of the reagents.</p>


<h3><a id="ABSORPTION_OF_WATER"></a>THE SEED COAT IN RELATION TO THE ABSORPTION OF WATER.</h3>

<p>A study of permeable seeds soaked in water containing stains
showed that there were no local regions through which the water
passed. The stains passed through all regions of the seed coat.
Coating the micropylar region with vaseline retarded germination,
but had no effect upon the percentage of germination at the end of
three days. In seed coats through which the stain had passed, the
light line was not stained. Some stain was found in the canals which
crossed the light line, and much more in the cell cavities. There was
no evidence that the stain had permeated the substance of the light
line. It was able to cross the light line only when pores were present.</p>

<p>In impermeable seeds the stains passed readily to the light line.
(<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 7.</a>) It was evident that the absorption of water was not
prevented by either the cuticularized layer or the cone-shaped structures
of the Malpighian layer, but by the light line. The region outside
of the light line became stained in a few hours, but there was no
trace of the stain within the light line after the seeds had remained
a week in the stains. Alcohol did not penetrate the seed coat more
readily than water.</p>


<h3><a id="PERMEABLE_AND_IMPERMEABLE"></a>A COMPARISON OF PERMEABLE AND IMPERMEABLE SEED COATS.</h3>

<p>No difference in chemical structure was found between the coats of
permeable and impermeable seeds. The principal differences were
in the character and amount of thickening of the cell walls.</p>

<p>In many of the permeable seeds some of the canals were found to
extend across the light line, but this was not true for all permeable
seeds. (<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 8.</a>) Oblique sections of permeable seed coats
showed that the cell cavities, although reduced to mere pores by the
thickening of their radial walls, extended across the light line into
the base of the cones, thus forming a passageway through which the
stains passed to the larger portions of the cell cavities below the light
line. (<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 4.</a>)</p>

<p>In the coats of the impermeable seeds the light line was usually
broader, the Malpighian cells thickened more below the light line,
and the main cavities of the Malpighian cells were more reduced and
farther below the light line than in the coats of permeable seeds.
(<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 6.</a>) No canals except occasionally a few very small ones
were seen crossing the light line in impermeable seeds. Cross and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
oblique sections showed that the lumina of the Malpighian cells were
closed in the region of the light line. Thus it was found that permeable
and impermeable seeds differ mainly in the amount of thickening
which occurs in the walls of the Malpighian cells. In the impermeable
seeds the thickening which begins at the outer tangential wall
of the Malpighian cell extends farther toward the inner tangential
wall, leaving the cell lumina smaller and farther below the light line than
in permeable seeds. The thickening is also more complete in impermeable
seeds, leaving fewer and smaller canals across the light line
as well as closing the cell lumina in the region of the light line.</p>


<h3><a id="SULPHURIC_ACID"></a>THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON THE COATS OF IMPERMEABLE SEEDS.</h3>

<p>Impermeable seeds were soaked in concentrated sulphuric acid
(sp. gr. 1.84) for 15, 30, and 60 minutes; then washed and put in the
staining solutions. After they had swollen, they were removed from
the staining solutions, dried, and embedded in glycerin gum. A
study of these seeds showed that the acid had eaten away all of the
material outside of the light line and that the stain had passed
through all regions of the seed coat. (<a href="#plate5">Pl. V, fig. 10.</a>) When observed
under the microscope, it was seen that the action of the acid was
rapid, destroying the cuticle, cuticularized layer, and cones in about
5 minutes. After 15 minutes treatment with acid the light line,
aside from the presence of canals and pores not previously visible,
seemed to be very little affected. The division lines along which the
lateral walls of the Malpighian cells were joined now became much
more distinct across the light line, thus indicating that there was
some swelling in this region. When a close examination of the path
of the stain was made the cell lumina, and occasionally very small
pores, were found to extend across the light line. The presence of
the stain in the pores indicated that they were paths of the stain
across the light line. Some of the stain passed along the lines between
cells and through the occasional canals crossing the light line,
but judging from the intensity of the stain in the lumina the canals
appeared to be the principal passageways.</p>

<p>The action of the acid in opening the cell cavities across the light
line was not determined. It may be due to the swelling of the light
line or to the removal of substances closing the pores.</p>

<p>No seeds were exposed to the acid for longer than an hour, but at the
end of this period the light line was still intact. As compared with
other portions of the Malpighian layer, it is extremely resistant to
concentrated sulphuric acid. Since all cell walls below the light line
are mainly cellulose, the resistance of the light line prevents the acid
from destroying the entire seed coat and reaching the embryo.</p>
